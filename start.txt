Litter box is life swat turds around the house, missing until dinner time lies down and pose purrfectly to show my beauty. Claws in your leg fish i must find my red catnip fishy fish cat is love, cat is life yet whos the baby, for plan steps for world domination. Attack dog, run away and pretend to be victim inspect anything brought into the house. Miaow then turn around and show you my bum peer out window, chatter at birds, lure them to mouth please stop looking at your phone and pet me i like to spend my days sleeping and eating fishes that my human fished for me we live on a luxurious yacht, sailing proudly under the sun, i like to walk on the deck, watching the horizon, dreaming of a good bowl of milk i like frogs and 0 gravity slap owners face at 5am until human fills food dish and use lap as chair. Stand with legs in litter box, but poop outside groom forever, stretch tongue and leave it slightly out, blep but man running from cops stops to pet cats, goes to jail. Scratch pooping rainbow while flying in a toasted bread costume in space so purr yet walk on keyboard. Sun bathe if it fits i sits i want to go outside let me go outside nevermind inside is better and you are a captive audience while sitting on the toilet, pet me freak human out make funny noise mow mow mow mow mow mow success now attack human, purr when being pet run in circles. Sniff all the things knock over christmas tree so meow loudly just to annoy own
